Discover the world of "Kernel Programming" and learn how to create your very own Kernel from scratch.

This project is the first in a serie of 10 projects, introducing into the Kernel world. This first project is a very basic kernel with some features.

Is based on a i386 (x86) architecture.

**Options**:
- [x] Color support
- [x] Keyboard handler
- [x] Helper 'printk'
- [ ] Scroll and cursor support
- [x] Different screens helper and keyboard shortcut
- [x] Create Iso image from kernel binary

**Shortcuts**:
- **F1**: go to previous screen
- **F2**: go to next screen

**TODO**:
- Cursor in position before changing screen (actually, it's going to end of buffer)
- Clean code for .h please
- Store files in different folders (in src/kernel)
- Control deletion on terminal (keep in memory the last char that can be deleted)
- Check for TODO in code

*NB: you can use the dependencies.txt to install all necessaries packages. ``sudo apt/dnf install $(cat dependencies.txt)``*

## KERNEL

### Compilation

#### Simple way

```
make
```

#### Hard way

```
$ nasm -f elf32 boot.asm -o boot.o
$ gcc -m32 -c kernel.c -o kernel.o
$ ld -m elf_i386 -T link.ld -o [your kernel name] boot.o kernel.o
```

<i>It is recommended to name your kernel with the formal</i>: ``kernel-<version>``. <i>I named mine "kernel-kfs.1.rleseur".</i>

### Run on QEMU

#### Simple way

```
make run-kernel
```

#### Hard way

```
qemu-system-i386 -kernel [your compiled kernel]
```

### Installation

- Take the last Debian ISO and make a VM in virtualbox.

- Clone the repo in it.

- Copy the compiled kernel in ``/boot`` directory.

- Modify the ``/boot/grub/grub.cfg`` and add an entry:

```
menuentry 'My Kernel' {
	set root='hd0,msdos1'
	multiboot /boot/[your compiled kernel] ro
}
```

- Reboot and select ``My Kernel`` entry.

## ISO

### Compilation

#### Simple way

```
make iso
```

#### Hard way

```
$ mkdir -p /iso/boot/grub
$ cp [your compiled kernel] /iso/boot
$ cp grub.cfg /iso/boot/grub
$ grub-mkrescue -o [your iso name] iso
```

### Run on QEMU

#### Simple way

```
make run-iso
```

#### Hard way

```
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom [your iso]
```
